# The while statement

# The while statement allows you to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true.
# A while statement is an example of what is called a looping statement. 
# A while statement can have an optional else clause.

# The True and False are called Boolean types and you can consider them to be equivalent to the value 1 and 0 respectively.
