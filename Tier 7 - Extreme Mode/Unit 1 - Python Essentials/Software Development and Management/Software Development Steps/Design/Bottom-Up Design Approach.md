# **Bottom-Up Design Approach**
Bottom up program design starts with the component parts and repeatedly combines them to achieve the general concept.

## **Advantage**
- Create robust, reusable low-level utilities then decide how they will be put together to create high-level construct.

## **Disadvantage**
- The complete program does not exist without the addition of the last module such that testing of system-level functions is not possible during development.

## **Example: Generating Quizzes**
- **Basic Elements:** Question Model, Difficulty Level, Topic Filters
- **Functional Module:** Quiz Generation - selects questions based on specified criteria like difficulty level and topic.
- **Integration into Major Function:** Quiz Engine - uses the Quiz Generation module to create quizzes, tracks user answers, and calculates scores.
- **Core Component Formation:** The Quiz Engine is integrated with User Management and Results Analysis to form a comprehensive educational product.
