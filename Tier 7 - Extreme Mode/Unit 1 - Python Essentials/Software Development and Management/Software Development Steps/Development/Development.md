# **Development**

The Development phase is where the actual creation of the software takes place. It's where concepts and plans become actual software that users can interact with. The Development phase is dynamic and iterative, with a focus on creating a functional and effective software product. Through coding, testing, and integration, the development team move from concept to reality, ready for deployment.

## **Outcomes of the Development Phase**
- Translation of design documents into executable code.
- Building the software's core functionalities and user interface.
- Integration of different software components and systems.
- Conducting unit testing to ensure individual components work correctly.

## **Key Aspects**
**Writing Code:** The heart of the Development phase is writing the source code. Developers use programming languages (like Python, JavaScript, HMTL, CSS) to create the software based on the previously prepared design documents. 

**Implementing Functionality:** Developers start implementing the software's functionalities defined in the design phase. This includes the logic and user interface elements that facilitate an effective UX.

**Integration:** In this step, the various components of the software (such as user authentication, score tracking, challenge completion, and feedback systems) are integrated to work together seamlessly. This ensures that the software operates as a cohesive unit, providing a smooth user experience.

**Testing:** Unit testing is performed by developers to ensure each component or unit of the software works as intended. This involves testing individual functions and modules to catch and fix errors early. For example, a unit test might verify that the scoring system accurately calculates and updates a student's score after completing a quiz.

**Version Control:** Developers use version control systems to manage changes to the software codebase. This allows multiple developers to work on the game simultaneously, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary. It's crucial for coordinating team efforts and maintaining a history of the project's evolution.

**Documentation:** Throughout the development process, developers document their code and the software's architecture. This documentation is essential for future maintenance, updates, and allows new developers to understand the software's workings quickly.

**Feedback Loop:** Integrating feedback from test users (potentially including actual Year 11 students) can help refine the software. This might involve adjusting difficulty levels, enhancing user interfaces, or adding new features to improve the educational value and engagement of the software.
