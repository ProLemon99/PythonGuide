# **Understanding the Need**

The requirements definition phase aims to systematically gather, organise, and document the specific needs and functionalities of the software.

## **Outcomes**
- Understanding the client's needs and expectations for the software.
- Gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, and discussions.
- Analysing requirements to ensure clarity, feasibility, and completeness.

## **Key Aspects**
**Understanding the Purpose:** Define the purpose of the software by understanding the needs and objectives of the end-users or stakeholders.

**Gathering Requirements:** Engage with stakeholders using techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observations to gather comprehensive requirements.

**Documenting Requirements:** Document the gathered requirements in a structured and understandable manner. Use tools like requirement specification documents, use cases, user stories, or visual models to represent these requirements.

**Analysing and Prioritising Requirements:** Analyse and evaluate the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and feasible. Prioritise requirements based on their importance, dependencies, and impact on the overall software.

**Managing Changes:** Expect changes in requirements during the software development lifecycle. Implement a robust change management process to handle modifications effectively while maintaining the project scope and schedule.

**Validation and Verification:** Validate requirements by ensuring they align with the stakeholders' needs and expectations.

**Communication and Collaboration:** Foster open communication and collaboration among stakeholders, developers, testers, and other relevant parties to ensure a shared understanding of requirements.

**Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop to continuously review and refine the requirements based on new insights, evolving needs, or changing circumstances.

**Documentation:** Regularly update and maintain requirement documentation throughout the development process to keep it synchronised with any changes or refinements.
