# **Top-Down Design Approach**

Top down program design is an approach to program design that starts with the general concept and repeatedly breaks it down into its component parts. Top down allows you to see the big picture immediately and discover the details as you go. It can be useful if you are starting your software from scratch as you may not know any of the specific details.

## **Advantages**
- Breaking problems into parts help us to identify what needs to be done.
- At each step of refinement, new parts will become less complex and therefore easier to solve.
- Parts of the solution may turn out to be reusable.
- Breaking problems into parts allows more than one person to solve the problem. 

## **Disadvantages**
- You may not see any 'show stoppers' until well into the effort.

## **Example: Managing Users**
- **Core Component:** User Management
- **Major Functions:** User Registration, Login, Profile Management
- **Sub-Components for User Registration:** Form Presentation, Form Validation, User Data Storage
- **Implementation Details:** Use Django's User model for data storage, forms.ModelForm for the registration form, and a view function to validate data and create a new user instance.
