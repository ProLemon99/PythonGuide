# **Key Questions to Ask**

Defining the requirements for a software project might seem straightforward at first, but it can quickly become deceptively complex if the right questions are not asked.

Consider the scenario where a teacher is preparing students for the Trial HSC Examinations and wants to replace traditional laminated flashcards with an interactive educational software solution.

At first glance, this seems simple: **Create a digital version of flashcards that can be accessed by students on their mobile devices.**

## **Who is the client and what are their needs?**
The process begins by identifying who the client is and what their specific needs are. In this case, the software is intended to be used by both the teacher and the students, but the requirements of each user group can differ significantly. For example, the teacher needs to be able to add, modify, and organise questions regularly, while students need easy access to the questions and answers without requiring extensive instructions.

A critical question arises: how will the questions be managed? Will the number of questions be fixed, or will they be updated periodically? If they are updated, who will be responsible for this—will it be the teacher, or could students potentially add their own questions? This consideration affects whether the software needs an interface for managing content, potentially requiring a database to store and retrieve questions, and possibly a server to handle authentication and security.

## **What is the deployment context?**
Moreover, the deployment context adds another layer of complexity. The software needs to function on multiple platforms, including mobile devices and potentially PCs, which raises questions about the best architecture to use. Should the solution be web-based to ensure it is accessible across different devices? If so, this would require careful consideration of user experience (UX) design to ensure it is intuitive and functional on both small screens and larger displays.

Security is another crucial aspect. If students can access the software outside of class, perhaps as homework, should their access be password protected? This introduces additional requirements for user authentication and data protection, potentially necessitating a server to manage these functions securely.

The project’s scope further expands when considering how the software might be used in different contexts. Will it be used solely in the classroom, or could it also be used at home by parents or in other educational settings? Each new use case could introduce additional requirements, making the software more complex and challenging to design.

## **Seemingly simple, surprisingly complex**
In this example, a seemingly simple task—replacing flashcards with interactive software—evolves into a large-scale project requiring careful planning and a thorough understanding of the client’s needs.

The complexity of the project underscores the importance of asking the right questions during the requirements definition phase.

Without this critical step, important aspects might be overlooked, leading to a product that fails to meet the needs of its users or requires significant rework later in the development process.

## **Asking the right questions**
Effective requirements definition is about more than just understanding what the client wants; it involves anticipating potential challenges, considering various use cases, and ensuring that the final product is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

By asking the right questions from the outset, software engineers can better manage the complexity of projects and deliver solutions that fully meet the needs of their clients.
