# **Algorithms, Flowcharts, Pseudocode**

## **Algorithms**
It is expected that you are able to develop and interpret algorithms represented as pseudocode and flowcharts.

It is important to start complex algorithms with a clear, uncluttered mainline. The mainline should reference required subroutines, the details of which are shown in separate algorithms.

Each subroutine should be concise and correctly make use of further subroutines for detailed logic.
