# **Example: Payment Program**

## **Scenario:**
We have two Python modules:

1. **orders.py** – Handles order creation.
2. **payments.py** – Processes payments.

When an order is placed, it sends the order details to the payment module for processing.

## **Step 1: Define the `payments` Module**
```payments.py```

```python
def process_payment(order_id, amount):
    print(f"Processing payment of ${amount} for Order {order_id}")
    return f"Payment for Order {order_id} successful"
```

## **Step 2: Integrate with the `orders` Module**
```orders.py```

```python
from payments import * # Import the payments module

def place_order():
    order_id = 101
    amount = 50.00
    confirmation = payments.process_payment(order_id, amount)  # Integration happens here
    print(confirmation)

place_order() # Run the function to simulate order placement
```

## **Expected Output:**
```
Processing payment of $50.0 for Order 101
Payment for Order 101 successful
```
