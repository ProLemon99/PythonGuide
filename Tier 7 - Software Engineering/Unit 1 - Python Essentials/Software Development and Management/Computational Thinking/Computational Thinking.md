# **Computational Thinking**

Computational thinking is a problem-solving approach that entails breaking down complex problems into more manageable parts, focusing on the essential details (abstraction), and devising algorithms to solve these problems.

It is a mindset that is not only applicable to programming but also to understanding and solving real-world problems.

By applying computational thinking, you can effectively tackle intricate challenges in a systematic and logical manner.

## **Applying Computational Thinking to a Project**
For larger projects, computational thinking will enable developers to deconstruct the educational process into discrete, manageable components.

Key components such as user authentication, question delivery, answer validation, and progress tracking can be individually developed, tested, and refined before being integrated into the larger system.

This structured approach ensures that each part of the application functions correctly and efficiently, contributing to the overall success of the project.

By integrating computational thinking into the project's development process, developers can manage complexity more effectively and create a robust, well-organised application. Each component, whether it is a module, an abstraction, or an algorithm, is carefully designed and tested independently. This not only makes the development process more manageable but also enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application.

## **Algorithmic Thinking**
Algorithmic thinking involves devising a step-by-step solution or set of rules to solve a particular problem. Most of the time, developers will need to develop algorithms for tasks such as:

- **User Authentication:** Validating user credentials and managing sessions.
- **Question Delivery:** Randomising or sequencing questions to present to users.
- **Answer Validation:** Checking user responses against correct answers and providing feedback.

By developing and refining these algorithms, developers can ensure that their application performs efficiently and accurately, providing a seamless experience for the users.
