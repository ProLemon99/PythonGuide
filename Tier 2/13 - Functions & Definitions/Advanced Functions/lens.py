# The len() function in Python returns the number of items in an object, such as strings, lists, or dictionaries. 
# To get the length of a string in Python, you use len() with the string as an argument, like len("example"). 
# To find the length of a list in Python, you pass the list to len() , like len([1, 2, 3]).

x = "this will output the number of items in a string or list"
print(len(x))
