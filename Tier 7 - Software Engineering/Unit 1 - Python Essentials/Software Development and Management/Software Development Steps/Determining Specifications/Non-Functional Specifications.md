# **Non-Functional Specifications**

Non-functional Specifications, unlike functional ones, do not involve transforming inputs into outputs but are crucial for a software project's success.

These specifications set the development framework and affect user experience, focusing on the system's operation and performance rather than its functionality.

Non-functional specifications are from the userâ€™s perspective in that they directly influence the standards for interface design including:

- use of menus
- use of frames to group items
- use of colour
- placement of common elements
- wording of messages and the tone of the language
- font to be used for prompts and user inputs
- size and nature of icons
