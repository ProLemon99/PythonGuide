# **Design**

In the design phase, the focus shifts to how the software will be built to meet the specified requirements.

This involves planning the overall structure and organisation of the system, defining the components, their interactions, and the technologies to be used.

Just as planning the architecture of a building involves detailed schematics and plans for constructing each part, software design involves creating models and diagrams that detail how the software will be implemented.

## **Key Aspects**
**Understanding the Goal:** Recognise the need for the project.

**Sketching the User Interface:** Draw a simple layout showing how the User Interface might look and function.

**Deciding on Functionality:** Plan how the software will analyse input, process and produce output.

**Choosing the Right Tools:** Select programming tools and languages that are best suited for creating simple, interactive educational software.

**Drafting Pseudo-code or Flowcharts:** Write down a basic outline of how the software will function, using pseudo-code or flowcharts to map.

**Planning for Feedback and Corrections:** Design a way to give instant feedback to users with explanations of corrections if needed.

**Accessibility and Simplicity:** Ensure the software is easy to use and navigate, with clear and simple prompts to move around the application.

**Feedback Loop:** Plan to show your initial designs to the client and get feedback to refine your ideas.

**Prototyping:** Optionally, create a simple prototype or mockup to show how the software might look and work. This can be a drawing or a very basic digital version.
